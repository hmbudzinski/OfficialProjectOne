## User Story

As a dessert lover

I can search for dessert keywords

So that I can satisfy my craving

## Overview

For our first group project we were asked to come together as a team to solve a
real world problem using data from multiple server-side API requests.

### Goals:

- Work together as a group
- Create a functional app to search for dessert recipes
- Navigate the murky waters of a shared GitHub repo

### Kanban

After the start of the project it quickly became apperant that each member of
the team liked to have a clear idea of which step they should be working on
next. Kanban, being built into GitHub, came in as a great tool for us. We worked
together to break down the project into simple steps, and worked together to
move the steps from our personal to-do lists into the "done" bucket.

### Two Server-Side APIs

We chose to work with Edamam and Spoonacular for the first time, as well as
bring in Giphy.

Edamam provided us with a json object to manipulate that allowed us to display
the recipe title, image, and link. With each user search we were able to limit
the search to three responses, as well as limit by vegan desserts, peanut free
desserts, and tree nut free desserts.

As happy as desserts make everyone, we knew we needed to bring more joy to the
world. That's where Spoonacular's database of food related jokes came in. BRI DO
YOU WANT TO TALK ABOUT THIS API SOME MORE?

ONLY INCLUDE GIPHY IF WE END UP USING IT.

### CSS Framework: Skeleton

CINDY CAN YOU WRITE UP A PARAGRAPH ABOUT SKELETON PLEASE

### New Third-Party API

Once the project had started to really take shape, the team knew we needed
something to create a more beautifully interactive application. With the use of
Jquery UI we were able to add some really exciting features.

- Predictive search Using the Cupcake Ipsum's array of delicious dessert
  options, we implimented the ability to choose from a list of suggested search
  terms after the user begins typing. We added to the array to make it even more
  accessible, and styled the drop down to fit with the rest of our page's
  styling

- BRI WHAT DID YOU END UP ADDING FROM UI?

### Achieving Polished, Mobile First UI
